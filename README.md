# Ketchup-Localisation
 Public Localisation Files for Ketchup

Ketchup’s translations are stored in Xcloc files, which are a little bit of a pain to work with. You can use Xcode if you already have it, or https://www.cunningo.com/locastudio/index.html.

Much of the text within Ketchup comes directly from PokéAPI, and I’ve used the localised text they’ve provided as much as possible. What remains is all the interface text in the app, and a few things I’ve written myself to be clearer or more readable. 

To start with, I’ve used machine tranlation to do the initial localisations. I realise the results aren’t great, but at least they’re a starting point.
